A curriculum vitae (CV) provides a synopsis of an individual's achievements. The CV content varies by profession. Academic CVs feature prominently a publication section. This section references the researcher's journal papers and other scholarly products.

Search, promotion, and award committees that screen CVs go through lists of publications trying to form opinions about the candidates' records. Does candidate A or B have enough publications? Are they of high quality? Did they have any impact on the research community?
In a highly competitive context, these questions do not always have clear answers. Another question that needs to be addressed is whether the candidate has been funded. If so, has the candidate done justice to the amount of funding obtained? This also enables one to decide if the candidate's output is in proportion with the input.
