   {\bf ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}\\
\end{center}


I would like to give my deepest gratitude towards Dr. Ioannis Pavlidis, who has been guiding me through my research. He has given me numerous opportunities throughout my PhD years, and always shared his views and experience in several of the projects that I worked upon. The amount of knowledge and experience I have gained from him is priceless.\\

\noindent
I want to thank all my committee members, Dr. Zhigang Deng, Dr. Guoning Chen, and Dr. Brian Uzzi for their advice and feedback making this research possible. Also, I thank all lab members for being my colleagues and friends; especially, Dinesh Majeti, whom I have been working closely with.\\

\noindent
Last but not least, my family is the backbone of my success. Being able to continue my education in America was only a dream. And to this very day, I cannot believe I was able to fulfill my dream. It is all thanks to my family. Although we are miles away and seas apart, my family made me feel as if I were home. I cannot be more thankful for their unconditional love, encouragement, motivation, and support.
